# Tasks

- [ ] exercises (see book [Practical Python Design Patterns](./src/lnk/[book]%20Practical%20Python%20Design%20Patterns_%20Pythonic%20Solutions%20to%20Common%20Problems.pdf%20-%20Shortcut.lnk))
- [ ] [Notebook](./ntb/practicalPythonDesignPatterns.ipynb)  explode into multiple interconnected files

# Content

- [Development](./dev/): scripts and notebooks for the development of classes and functions.
- [Documentation](./doc/): some notes reported into documentation files.
- [Notebooks](./ntb/): a collection of design patterns from the book `Practical Python Design Patterns`. Some exercises for practicing are provided.
- [Objects](./obj/): classes and functions to be imported into other scripts.
- [Playground](./plg/): a playground to practice design patterns.
- [Sources](./src/): sources and utilities:
  - [python-patterns](./src/python-patterns/): a collection of design patterns and idioms, including their testing. More details into [readme.md](./src/python-patterns/README.md).
  - [Slides for the Training](./src/slides/): slides of the training on design patterns.

## Playground

Prefixes: `[pattern-calssification]_[progressive-index]_[filename].ipynb` where `pattern-classification`:

- `00_`: general
- `01_`: creational
- `02_`: structral
- `03_`: behavioral

List:

- [00 Abstract Classes](./plg/00_01_abstract_classes.ipynb): playing with *abstract classes*.
- [01 Maze Upgraded](./plg/01_00_maze_abstract_factory_builder.ipynb): an example of a class building a maze, it is upgraded by `Abstract Factory` and `Builder`.
- [01 Abstract Factory](./plg/01_02_abstract_factory.ipynb): `Abstract Factory` implementation of a GUI's generating multiple graphical components for different opertaing ssytems.
- [01 Builder](./plg/01_03_builder.ipynb): `Builder` implementation of a house builder.
- [01 Factory Method](./plg/01_04_factory_method.ipynb): `Factory Method` implementation of a vehicle factory. Direct comparison vs `Abstraact Factory` is also reporeted.
- [01 Prototype](./plg/01_05_prototype.ipynb): `Prototype` implementation explained by a simple example.
