# Design Patterns Tasks

- [ ] `#u` `Interpreter` logic and implementation
- [ ] `#q` is override mandatory for overriding, `struct` and `class`
- [ ] `#q` what if a virtual method is not `=0` (i.e. declared but not defined)
- [ ] `#q` pure abstract class/struct vs abstract class/struct
  
- âœ… done
  - [x] `#f` `State` cpp
  - [x] `#f` `Strategy` cpp
  - [x] `#u` `Iterator` logic and implementation
  - [x] classes: practice with pointers and normal declaration
