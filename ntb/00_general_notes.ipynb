    "`Design Patterns` are mental models to be applied for solving problems. They all contain the following:\n",
    "- Pattern name\n",
    "- Intent/purpose\n",
    "- Aliases\n",
    "- Motivation/context\n",
    "- Problem\n",
    "- Solution\n",
    "- Structure\n",
    "- Participants\n",
    "- Collaborations\n",
    "- Consequences/constraints\n",
    "- Implementation\n",
    "- Sample code\n",
    "- Known uses\n",
    "- Related patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "They are classified into different groupings:\n",
    "- **Creational** : deal with elements in they systems, specifically how they are created.\n",
    "- **Structural** : deal with how classes and objects are composed.\n",
    "- **Behaviorals** : focused on interaction between objects.\n",

    "## Principles of OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "The two main principles for solving common problems with object oriented programming are:\n",
    "1. Program to an **interface**, not an implementation.\n",
    "2. Favor **object composition** over inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `open/closed` principle (by _B. Meyer_):\n",
    "\n",
    "> _software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification._\n",
    "\n",
    "**Middleware Layer**: a layer that sits in the middle between the client making requests of the app and the actual application. It is the layer that both the requests from the client and the responses from the main application functions need to pass through.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DRY** Principle: _Don't Repeat Yourself_. \n",
    "\n",
    "**YAGNI** Principle: _You Ain't Gonna Need It_ (i.e. avoid building structures or functionalities that will not be used).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Broken Windows**: The pieces of code that are not right and will not be easy to maintain and extend. So they mostly remain like they are, unless you strongly act on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Duck Typing**: Duck typing in computer programming is an application of the duck test—\"If it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck\"—to determine whether an object can be used for a particular purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Separation of Concern\n",
    "\n",
    "**Separation and isolation** is one of the most commonly used patterns to be used to optimize, extend, and cleaning up existing systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Every object should have one responsibility and one responsibility only**. The more cleanly you separate the concerns in your objects, and the better you isolate their purpose. It will be easier to maintain your code, update it, or find and fix bugs. You should build programs in such a way that yu can constantly swap out bits of the program without changing any other part of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Programming to an interface** allows creating better separation between code parts that accomplish separated tasks. The more clearer is the separation of the system into distinct units (each with its own concern or tasks) and the more independent of one another these sections are, the easier it becomes to maintain and extend the system. \n",
    "As long as the interface is fixed, it is possible to switch to newer and better ways of doing things without requiring a complete overall of existing system.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Motivation Extracts\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to be able to solve big, complex problems you need to **think on a higher level**. The target is to arrive looking at a brand-new problem and rapidly deconstruct it into high-level parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "After mastering this set of patterns, actively seek out and master different tools and techniques. Study recipes and patterns whenever you find them and translate them into an **abstract solution** that you can use over and over.\n",
    "Pick personal projects that force you to use design patterns you have yet to master. Have fun with it. **Learn to love the process**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suggestions to become a **better programmer**:\n",
    "- When you must work on a piece of existing code, leave the code better than you found it.\n",
    "- Try to complete a quick problem-solving challenge every day.\n",
    "- Look for opportunities to work with people who are better programmers than you are (open source projects are great for this).\n",
    "- Focus on deliberate practice.\n",
    "- Practice systems thinking whenever you can find an excuse.\n",
    "- Collect and analyze mental models.\n",
    "- Master your tools and understand what they are good for and what they should not be used for.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deliberate Practice** is all that yuou need. It is slow, halting, anti-flow. It has these components:\n",
    "- Each practice session has a **single focus**: every practice run is a single reinforcement of the skill.\n",
    "- The distance (time) between attempt and feedback is as short as possible.\n",
    "- Work on something that you cannot yet do.\n",
    "- Follow in the path of those who have gone before you.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stretch yourself**: the only way to get over discomfort things is to dive deep into them, to use that tool so many tumes and in so many ways that you begin to get a feel for it. Spend as much time as possbible in these **ego-destroying zones**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try using **laguages with different paradigms** to solve similar problems, taking from each and shaping a solution yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Know when to **stop**: you need to develop the mental fortitude to say enough is enough and start over, building a new solution using what you have learned. No amount of time spent on a solution means anything if it is the wrong solution. The sooner you realize that the better.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Everything is a system**. By understanding what elements make up the system, how they are connected, and how they interact with one another, you can understand the system. By learning to deconstruct and understand systems, you inevitably teach yourself how to design and build systems. Every piece of software out there is an expression of these three core components: the elements that make up the solution, and a set of connections and interactions between them."
