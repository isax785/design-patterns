    "A miscellanea of notes that support the development and enhance the comprehension of the topics contained in this repo.\n",

    "## Shallow Copy vs Deep Copy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python variables are esentially pointers to addresses in memory where the relevant values are stored**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from copy import deepcopy\n",
    "\n",
    "sample_list = [1, 2, 3, [4, 5]]\n",
    "same_list = sample_list  # points to the same list\n",
    "shallow_copy = sample_list[:]  # copy of the list content\n",
    "deep_copy = deepcpy(sample_list)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Shallow Copy** : copy of the first level of the object. Only the [1,2,3] part of the `sample_list` is copied, while [4,5] points to the same list.\n",
    "- **Deep Copy** : all the levels of the object are copied.\n",

    "## Virtualenv\n",
    "\n",
    "`virtualenv` package allows setting the proper environment for the project under development, without superposing to other environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. install `virtualenv` package: \n",
    "    - `$ pip install virtualenv`\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "2. create an environment: in terminal, go to the directory you will be working in. Next, create a virtual environment where you will install the packages needed for the projects (e.g. new virtualenv called _ppdenv_).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Linux: `$ virtualenv -p python3 ppdpenv`\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Win: `$ virtualenv -p python ppdpenv`\n",
    "    \n",
    "    If Python 3 is not part of your PATH, you can use the full path to the Python executable you want to use inside your virtualenv. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Activate the virtual environment\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Linux: `$ source ./ppdpenv/bin/activate`\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Win (CMD): `$ ppdpenv\\Scripts\\activate`\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Whenever we have this environment active and install a new package using the pip command, the new package will only be installed in this environment, and will only be available to programs while this environment is active. Check Python version with `python3 --version`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. Exit virtual environment: `$ deactivate`\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Note</u>: when activating on Win Powershell/Terminal, check the execution policy of the terminal with `Get-ExecutionPolcy`. If `Restricted`, set it to another state in order to activate the virtualenv:\n",

    "## Metaclasses\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Metaclass**: In object-oriented programming, a metaclass is a class whose instances are classes. Just as an ordinary class defines the behavior of certain objects, a metaclass defines the behavior of certain classes and their instances. Not all object-oriented programming languages support metaclasses. Among those that do, the extent to which metaclasses can override any given aspect of class behavior varies. Metaclasses can be implemented by having classes be first-class citizens, in which case a metaclass is simply an object that constructs classes. Each language has its own metaobject protocol, a set of rules that govern how objects, classes, and metaclasses interact.\n",
    "- **Abstract Type**: In programming languages, an abstract type is a type in a nominative type system that cannot be instantiated directly; a type that is not abstract – which can be instantiated – is called a **Concrete Type**. <u>Every instance of an abstract type is an instance of some concrete subtype</u>. Abstract types are also known as existential types.\n",
    "An abstract type may provide no implementation, or an incomplete implementation. In some languages, abstract types with no implementation (rather than an incomplete implementation) are known as protocols, interfaces, signatures, or class types. In class-based object-oriented programming, abstract types are implemented as abstract classes (also known as abstract base classes), and concrete types as concrete classes. In generic programming, the analogous notion is a concept, which similarly specifies syntax and semantics, but does not require a subtype relationship: two unrelated types may satisfy the same concept.\n",
    "Often, abstract types will have one or more implementations provided separately, for example, in the form of concrete subtypes that can be instantiated. In object-oriented programming, an abstract class may include abstract methods or abstract properties that are shared by its subclasses. Other names for language features that are (or may be) used to implement abstract types include traits, mixins, flavors, roles, or type classes.\n",

    "    directly, and then acts as a mix-in class.  You can also register\n",
    "    unrelated concrete classes (even built-in classes) and unrelated\n",
