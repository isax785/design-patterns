    "# 9. Chain of Responsibility\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Chain and Responsibility` pattern allows us to shuffle and alter the handlers used at runtime. It can serve to encapsulate a processing of elements into a pipeline. A good rule of thumb is to use it wherever you have more than one potential handler for a request, and thus do not know beforehand which handler or handlers would best handle the requests you will receive.\n",
    "\n",
    "_The Middleware Layer is a key component of web frameworks: it sits in the middle between the client making requests of the app and the actual application. Both the requests from the client and the responses from the main application pass through it. Also the **routing** mechanism is part of the middleware layer._\n",
    "\n",
    "About web frameworks:\n",
    "- simple `Request` object (sent to the server):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Request(object):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, headers, url, body, GET, POST):\n",
    "        self.headers = headers\n",
    "        self.url = url\n",
    "        self.body = body\n",
    "        self.GET = GET\n",
    "        self.POST = POST\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- simple `Response` object (returned to the client):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Response(object):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, headers, status_code, body):\n",
    "        self.headers = headers\n",

    "## Chain Responsibility Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chain Responsibility Principle**: every piece of code does one thing and only one thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below the basic concept:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def function_1():\n",
    "    print('function_1')\n",
    "\n",
    "def function_2():\n",
    "    print('function_2')\n",
    "\n",
    "def function_3():\n",
    "    print('function_3')\n",
    "\n",
    "def main_function():\n",
    "    function_1()\n",
    "    function_2()\n",
    "    function_3()\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    main_function()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since it is not ideal to have the `main_function` call each of the functions in order (because it leads to a messy code), a better implementation leads to create a way to make a single call and then have the functions called dynamically. In this way, each function is clearly separated int its wn unit of code that can be plugged into, or removed from, the chain of classes. Each handler cares only abuot its own execution and ignores what happens when another handler executes because of the query."
