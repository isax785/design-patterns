    "\n",
    "`Factory Classes` define objects that take a certain set of parameters and use that to create objects of some other class. `Abstract Factory Classes` serves as the template used to build factory classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, **polymorphism** is not a complete solution, since the code would need to be updated whenever a new object is created. The issue is the creation of new types, and not the use of these types.\n",
    "The goal is to create objects through a common interface rather than spreading the creation code throughout the system. One way of creting a centralized system of object creation is by using the factory pattern. This pattern has two distinct approaches:\n",
    "1. the simple factory method\n",
    "2. the abstract factory method\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Note:</u> The **prototype pattern** does not require sub-classing, but requires an `initialize` operation, whereas the **factory pattern** requires sub-classing but not initialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Factory Method\n",
    "\n",
    "When we want to call a method such that we pass in a string and get as a return value a _new object_, we are calling a **factory method**. The type of the object is determined by the string that is passed to the method.\n",
    "All constructors should be private or protected since it shuld not matter to the user of the class whether a new object is created or an old one recylcled. The idea is that the request for an object is decoupled from its creation."
