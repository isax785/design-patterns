    "\n",
    "The builder pattern does not use nmerous constructors; it uses a builder object (differently from an anti-pattern). This builder object receives each initialization parameter step by step and then returns the resulting constructed object as a single result.\n",
    "the `builder pattern` separates the construction of an object from the way the object is represented, so the representation of the object can be changed without changing the process by which it is constructed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Anti-pattern** is the opposite of a software **pattern**. They are usually a general way to work around or attempt to solve a specific type of problem, but are also the wrong way to solve the problem. Considering that **The Goal** is to write clean code that is easy to debug, easy to update, and easy to extend, anti-patterns lead to code that is exactly the opposite.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `Builder Pattern` the two main players are:\n",
    "- `Builder` : abstract class that knows how to build all the components of the final object.\n",
    "- `Director`: controls the process of the building. Its output is a fully initialized object.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an instance (or instances) of `Builder` that the `Director` uses to build the objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Builder pattern** focuses on building something step by step. For this, it is different from the **abstract factory** where a family of products can be created and returned immediatly using polimorphism. **Builder pattern** separates the construction of a complex object from its representation. \n",
    "\n",
    "A furthe advantage of this separation is the reduction of object size, which results in cleaner code. There is better control over the construction process and themodular nature allow us to easily make changes to the internal representation of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest downside is that a `ConcreteBuilder` must be created for each type of product to be created."

    "- _external_: have external code written in an external file or a string. The string or file is the read and parsed by the application before it gets used (e.g. CSS). A parser is needed (e.g. `PyParsing`).\n",

As a rule, whenever there s a publish-subscribe relationship between a single object (i.e. the `Observable`) and a set of observers, it is a good candidate for `Design Pattern`. Whenever the _Observable_ object changes its states and is polled for a chaneg, it alerts all the _Observers_ registered with it that they need to activate a callback. \n",
    "Although the `Observer Pattern` allows decoupling the objects that are observed frm knowing anything about the object oobserving them, the observer objects stll need to know which objects they need to observe. There is still a bt of coupling. Such pattern works well whena number of potential observable classes that an oobserver needs to register with is limited.\n",
    "The level of coupling between objects is the degree of knowledge that one object needs with regard to other objects that it interacts with. The more loosely objects are cupled, the less knowledge they have about each other, and the more flexible the object-orieted system is. Loosely coupled systems have fewer interdependencies between objects and as such are easier to update and maintain.\n",

It is mainly used to implement distributed event handling systems._\n",
    "\n",
    "The problems that the `Observer Pattern` solves are those where a group of objects has to respond to the change f state in some other object and d so withut causing more coupling inside the system. It s concerned with the management of events r responding to change of state in some sort of network of objects."

    "- **Controller** : all of the program processing happens inside an object that exists solely for controlling the flow of the program. This oobject handles actionsliker requesting data, receiving data, and dispatching responses to the command line. **Controllers** are the glue that holds the system together, and usually the place where the most action takes place. \n",

    "    - takes the user input;\n",
    "    - handles all the business logic;\n",
    "    - gets data from the model;\n",
    "    - sends the data to the vew to be transformed into the representation to be returned to the user.\n",
    "- **Model** : once a request is received and the controller decides what must happen to the request, some data from the system is needed. The structural representationo of data is referred to as a data model, and so the part of the program that deals with the data (getting, setting, updating, and deleting data) is called the **model**. It should be a program-side interface t data that abstracts away the need to directly interact with the data store, allowing to switch frma  file-based store to some key-value store or a full-on relational database system. Often, a model will contain the fields used as attrbutes on the object, allowing to interact with the database as with any other object.\n",
