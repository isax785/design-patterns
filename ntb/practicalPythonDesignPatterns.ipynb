It follows that everything needed to execute the instruction should be encapsulated in some kind of data structure. the _client_ that initiates the execution does nt have to know anything about way in which the instruction will be executed. the target object is called _receiver_, it is an instance of a class that can execute the method given the encapsulated information. All of this relies in an bject called an _invoker_ that decides when the method on the receiver will execute.\n",

    "Used whenever there is the need to dynamically decouple the source of a call from the called code. As a rule, whenever there s a publish-subscribe relationship between a single object (i.e. the `Observable`) and a set of observers, it is a good candidate for `Design Pattern`. Whenever the _Observable_ object changes its states and is polled for a chaneg, it alerts all the _Observers_ registered with it that they need to activate a callback. \n",
    "Although the `Observer Pattern` allows decoupling the objects that are observed frm knowing anything about the object oobserving them, the observer objects stll need to know which objects they need to observe. There is still a bt of coupling. Such pattern works well whena number of potential observable classes that an oobserver needs to register with is limited.\n",
    "The level of coupling between objects is the degree of knowledge that one object needs with regard to other objects that it interacts with. The more loosely objects are cupled, the less knowledge they have about each other, and the more flexible the object-orieted system is. Loosely coupled systems have fewer interdependencies between objects and as such are easier to update and maintain.\n",

It is mainly used to implement distributed event handling systems._\n",
    "\n",
    "The problems that the `Observer Pattern` solves are those where a group of objects has to respond to the change f state in some other object and d so withut causing more coupling inside the system. It s concerned with the management of events r responding to change of state in some sort of network of objects."

    "- **Controller** : all of the program processing happens inside an object that exists solely for controlling the flow of the program. This oobject handles actionsliker requesting data, receiving data, and dispatching responses to the command line. **Controllers** are the glue that holds the system together, and usually the place where the most action takes place. \n",
    "It is the hearth of the pattern, the part that marshalls all other classes. Users interact with the controller, and through it the whole system. It takes the following actions:\n",
    "    - takes the user input;\n",
    "    - handles all the business logic;\n",
    "    - gets data from the model;\n",
    "    - sends the data to the vew to be transformed into the representation to be returned to the user.\n",
    "- **Model** : once a request is received and the controller decides what must happen to the request, some data from the system is needed. The structural representationo of data is referred to as a data model, and so the part of the program that deals with the data (getting, setting, updating, and deleting data) is called the **model**. It should be a program-side interface t data that abstracts away the need to directly interact with the data store, allowing to switch frma  file-based store to some key-value store or a full-on relational database system. Often, a model will contain the fields used as attrbutes on the object, allowing to interact with the database as with any other object.\n",
