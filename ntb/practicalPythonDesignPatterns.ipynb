    "## Principles of OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "The two main principles for solving common problems with object oriented programming are:\n",
    "1. Program to an **interface**, not an implementation.\n",
    "2. Favor **object composition** over inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `open/closed` principle (by _B. Meyer_):\n",
    "\n",
    "> _software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification._\n",
    "\n",
    "**Middleware Layer**: a layer that sits in the middle between the client making requests of the app and the actual application. It is the layer that both the requests from the client and the responses from the main application functions need to pass through.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DRY** Principle: _Don't Repeat Yourself_. \n",
    "\n",
    "**YAGNI** Principle: _You Ain't Gonna Need It_ (i.e. avoid building structures or functionalities that will not be used).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Broken Windows**: The pieces of code that are not right and will not be easy to maintain and extend. So they mostly remain like they are, unless you strongly act on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Duck Typing**: Duck typing in computer programming is an application of the duck test—\"If it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck\"—to determine whether an object can be used for a particular purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Separation of Concern\n",
    "\n",
    "**Separation and isolation** is one of the most commonly used patterns to be used to optimize, extend, and cleaning up existing systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Every object should have one responsibility and one responsibility only**. The more cleanly you separate the concerns in your objects, and the better you isolate their purpose. It will be easier to maintain your code, update it, or find and fix bugs. You should build programs in such a way that yu can constantly swap out bits of the program without changing any other part of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Programming to an interface** allows creating better separation between code parts that accomplish separated tasks. The more clearer is the separation of the system into distinct units (each with its own concern or tasks) and the more independent of one another these sections are, the easier it becomes to maintain and extend the system. \n",
    "As long as the interface is fixed, it is possible to switch to newer and better ways of doing things without requiring a complete overall of existing system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Shallow Copy vs Deep Copy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python variables are esentially pointers to addresses in memory where the relevant values are stored**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from copy import deepcopy\n",
    "\n",
    "sample_list = [1, 2, 3, [4, 5]]\n",
    "same_list = sample_list  # points to the same list\n",
    "shallow_copy = sample_list[:]  # copy of the list content\n",
    "deep_copy = deepcpy(sample_list)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Shallow Copy** : copy of the first level of the object. Only the [1,2,3] part of the `sample_list` is copied, while [4,5] points to the same list.\n",
    "- **Deep Copy** : all the levels of the object are copied.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Virtualenv\n",
    "\n",
    "`virtualenv` package allows setting the proper environment for the project under development, without superposing to other environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. install `virtualenv` package: \n",
    "    - `$ pip install virtualenv`\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "2. create an environment: in terminal, go to the directory you will be working in. Next, create a virtual environment where you will install the packages needed for the projects (e.g. new virtualenv called _ppdenv_).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Linux: `$ virtualenv -p python3 ppdpenv`\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Win: `$ virtualenv -p python ppdpenv`\n",
    "    \n",
    "    If Python 3 is not part of your PATH, you can use the full path to the Python executable you want to use inside your virtualenv. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Activate the virtual environment\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Linux: `$ source ./ppdpenv/bin/activate`\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Win (CMD): `$ ppdpenv\\Scripts\\activate`\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Whenever we have this environment active and install a new package using the pip command, the new package will only be installed in this environment, and will only be available to programs while this environment is active. Check Python version with `python3 --version`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. Exit virtual environment: `$ deactivate`\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Note</u>: when activating on Win Powershell/Terminal, check the execution policy of the terminal with `Get-ExecutionPolcy`. If `Restricted`, set it to another state in order to activate the virtualenv:\n",
    "- `Set-ExecutionPolicy unrestricted`\n",
    "- `Set-ExecutionPolicy restricted`\n",
    "- `Set-ExecutionPolicy remotesigned`\n",
    "- `Set-ExecutionPolicy allsigned`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Metaclasses\n",
    "- **Metaclass**: In object-oriented programming, a metaclass is a class whose instances are classes. Just as an ordinary class defines the behavior of certain objects, a metaclass defines the behavior of certain classes and their instances. Not all object-oriented programming languages support metaclasses. Among those that do, the extent to which metaclasses can override any given aspect of class behavior varies. Metaclasses can be implemented by having classes be first-class citizens, in which case a metaclass is simply an object that constructs classes. Each language has its own metaobject protocol, a set of rules that govern how objects, classes, and metaclasses interact.\n",
    "- **Abstract Type**: In programming languages, an abstract type is a type in a nominative type system that cannot be instantiated directly; a type that is not abstract – which can be instantiated – is called a **Concrete Type**. <u>Every instance of an abstract type is an instance of some concrete subtype</u>. Abstract types are also known as existential types.\n",
    "An abstract type may provide no implementation, or an incomplete implementation. In some languages, abstract types with no implementation (rather than an incomplete implementation) are known as protocols, interfaces, signatures, or class types. In class-based object-oriented programming, abstract types are implemented as abstract classes (also known as abstract base classes), and concrete types as concrete classes. In generic programming, the analogous notion is a concept, which similarly specifies syntax and semantics, but does not require a subtype relationship: two unrelated types may satisfy the same concept.\n",
    "Often, abstract types will have one or more implementations provided separately, for example, in the form of concrete subtypes that can be instantiated. In object-oriented programming, an abstract class may include abstract methods or abstract properties that are shared by its subclasses. Other names for language features that are (or may be) used to implement abstract types include traits, mixins, flavors, roles, or type classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `abc` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Metaclass:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from abc import ABCMeta\n",
    "\n",
    "class ABCMeta(type):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Metaclass for defining Abstract Base Classes (ABCs).\n",
    "\n",
    "    Use this metaclass to create an ABC.  An ABC can be subclassed\n",
    "    directly, and then acts as a mix-in class.  You can also register\n",
    "    unrelated concrete classes (even built-in classes) and unrelated\n",
    "    ABCs as 'virtual subclasses' -- these and their descendants will\n",
    "    be considered subclasses of the registering ABC by the built-in\n",
    "    issubclass() function, but the registering ABC won't show up in\n",
    "    their MRO (Method Resolution Order) nor will method\n",
    "    implementations defined by the registering ABC be callable (not\n",
    "    even via super()).\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract method as decorator:\n",

    "    \"\"\"A decorator indicating abstract methods.\n",

    "    class that has a metaclass derived from ABCMeta cannot be\n",
    "    instantiated unless all of its abstract methods are overridden.\n",
    "    The abstract methods can be called using any of the normal\n",
    "    'super' call mechanisms.\n",

    "# Motivation Extracts\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to be able to solve big, complex problems you need to **think on a higher level**. The target is to arrive looking at a brand-new problem and rapidly deconstruct it into high-level parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "After mastering this set of patterns, actively seek out and master different tools and techniques. Study recipes and patterns whenever you find them and translate them into an **abstract solution** that you can use over and over.\n",
    "Pick personal projects that force you to use design patterns you have yet to master. Have fun with it. **Learn to love the process**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suggestions to become a **better programmer**:\n",
    "- When you must work on a piece of existing code, leave the code better than you found it.\n",
    "- Try to complete a quick problem-solving challenge every day.\n",
    "- Look for opportunities to work with people who are better programmers than you are (open source projects are great for this).\n",
    "- Focus on deliberate practice.\n",
    "- Practice systems thinking whenever you can find an excuse.\n",
    "- Collect and analyze mental models.\n",
    "- Master your tools and understand what they are good for and what they should not be used for.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deliberate Practice** is all that yuou need. It is slow, halting, anti-flow. It has these components:\n",
    "- Each practice session has a **single focus**: every practice run is a single reinforcement of the skill.\n",
    "- The distance (time) between attempt and feedback is as short as possible.\n",
    "- Work on something that you cannot yet do.\n",
    "- Follow in the path of those who have gone before you.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stretch yourself**: the only way to get over discomfort things is to dive deep into them, to use that tool so many tumes and in so many ways that you begin to get a feel for it. Spend as much time as possbible in these **ego-destroying zones**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try using **laguages with different paradigms** to solve similar problems, taking from each and shaping a solution yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Know when to **stop**: you need to develop the mental fortitude to say enough is enough and start over, building a new solution using what you have learned. No amount of time spent on a solution means anything if it is the wrong solution. The sooner you realize that the better.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Everything is a system**. By understanding what elements make up the system, how they are connected, and how they interact with one another, you can understand the system. By learning to deconstruct and understand systems, you inevitably teach yourself how to design and build systems. Every piece of software out there is an expression of these three core components: the elements that make up the solution, and a set of connections and interactions between them."

    "# <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"singleton\">1. The Singleton Pattern</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Singleton Pattern** is a pretty way to get a **global state**. \n",
    "Generally, global states should be avoided because code in one part of the project may  alter the global state and cause unexpected results in a completely unrelated piece of code.\n",
    "However, when there are parts of a project that do not affect the execution of the code (e.g. logging, caching, load balancing, route mapping) it is acceptable to use global state. In all these cases, information flows in one direction, and **the singleton instance itself is immutable** (i.e. it does not change). No part of the program attempts to make a change in the singleton, and as such there is no danger of one part of a project interfering with another part of the project because of the shared state.\n",
    "\n",
    "In `Python` there is no real need to use singleton since a module with functions (and not a class) would serve well as a singleton. All its variables would be bound to the module, which could not be instantiated repeatedly anyway. There is no way of creating private classes or private constructors in Python, so it's not possible to protect it against multiple instantiations, other than just via convention in use of the API. Just put methods in a module, and consider the module as the singleton."

    "Used to send an instruction or set of instructions from one object to another, while keeping these object loosely coupled. It follows that everything needed to execute the instruction should be encapsulated in some kind of data structure. the _client_ that initiates the execution does nt have to know anything about way in which the instruction will be executed. the target object is called _receiver_, it is an instance of a class that can execute the method given the encapsulated information. All of this relies in an bject called an _invoker_ that decides when the method on the receiver will execute.\n",

    "Used whenever there is the need to dynamically decouple the source of a call from the called code. As a rule, whenever there s a publish-subscribe relationship between a single object (i.e. the `Observable`) and a set of observers, it is a good candidate for `Design Pattern`. Whenever the _Observable_ object changes its states and is polled for a chaneg, it alerts all the _Observers_ registered with it that they need to activate a callback. \n",
    "Although the `Observer Pattern` allows decoupling the objects that are observed frm knowing anything about the object oobserving them, the observer objects stll need to know which objects they need to observe. There is still a bt of coupling. Such pattern works well whena number of potential observable classes that an oobserver needs to register with is limited.\n",
    "The level of coupling between objects is the degree of knowledge that one object needs with regard to other objects that it interacts with. The more loosely objects are cupled, the less knowledge they have about each other, and the more flexible the object-orieted system is. Loosely coupled systems have fewer interdependencies between objects and as such are easier to update and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `Observer Pattern` there are two types of objects:\n",
    "- `Observable` class: can be watched by other classes.\n",
    "- `Observer` class: will be alerted whenever the two classes undergoes a change.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Observer Pattern` definition: _A software design pattern in which an object, called the subject, maintans a list of its dependents, called observers, and notfies the automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods. It is mainly used to implement distributed event handling systems._\n",
    "\n",
    "The problems that the `Observer Pattern` solves are those where a group of objects has to respond to the change f state in some other object and d so withut causing more coupling inside the system. It s concerned with the management of events r responding to change of state in some sort of network of objects."

    "\n",
    "The `Model-View-Controller Pattern` is a pattern of patterns. To be applied when the program receives some form of a request that must be interpreted and then kick off some relevant actions. It is sub-divided into three main objects:\n",
    "- **Controller** : all of the program processing happens inside an object that exists solely for controlling the flow of the program. This oobject handles actionsliker requesting data, receiving data, and dispatching responses to the command line. **Controllers** are the glue that holds the system together, and usually the place where the most action takes place. \n",
    "It is the hearth of the pattern, the part that marshalls all other classes. Users interact with the controller, and through it the whole system. It takes the following actions:\n",
    "    - takes the user input;\n",
    "    - handles all the business logic;\n",
    "    - gets data from the model;\n",
    "    - sends the data to the vew to be transformed into the representation to be returned to the user.\n",
    "- **Model** : once a request is received and the controller decides what must happen to the request, some data from the system is needed. The structural representationo of data is referred to as a data model, and so the part of the program that deals with the data (getting, setting, updating, and deleting data) is called the **model**. It should be a program-side interface t data that abstracts away the need to directly interact with the data store, allowing to switch frma  file-based store to some key-value store or a full-on relational database system. Often, a model will contain the fields used as attrbutes on the object, allowing to interact with the database as with any other object.\n",
    "- **View** : part of the code that deliceries the information back to the user. it should only deal with the output or rendering of data passed to it into some sort of format to be returned to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "**There is no business logic in Model neither in View!**\n",

Each class and its instances should be able to change wthout any changes being needed on the other side of the equation:\n",

The same location keeps an index of all the subscribers, as a result the number of publishers and subscribers can vary without having any impact on the rest of the system."
