    "# 1. The Singleton Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Singleton Pattern** is a pretty way to get a **global state**. \n",
    "Generally, global states should be avoided because code in one part of the project may  alter the global state and cause unexpected results in a completely unrelated piece of code.\n",
    "However, when there are parts of a project that do not affect the execution of the code (e.g. logging, caching, load balancing, route mapping) it is acceptable to use global state. In all these cases, information flows in one direction, and **the singleton instance itself is immutable** (i.e. it does not change). No part of the program attempts to make a change in the singleton, and as such there is no danger of one part of a project interfering with another part of the project because of the shared state.\n",
    "\n",
    "In `Python` there is no real need to use singleton since a module with functions (and not a class) would serve well as a singleton. All its variables would be bound to the module, which could not be instantiated repeatedly anyway. There is no way of creating private classes or private constructors in Python, so it's not possible to protect it against multiple instantiations, other than just via convention in use of the API. Just put methods in a module, and consider the module as the singleton."
