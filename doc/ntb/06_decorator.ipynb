    "\n",
    "To decorate a function, we need to return an object that can be used as a function.\n",
    "In Python everything is an object: functions are objects with a special `__call()__` method. If the decorator returns an object with a `__call()__` method, the result can be used as a function.\n",
    "In the `Decorator Pattern` the interface does not change, but new functionality is somehow adeed.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Example of **ProfilingDecorator** class</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "    def __init__(self, f):\n",

    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "The decorated function is saved as an attribute of the object during initialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decorator is a _unary funciton_ (i.e. a function that takes a single argument) that takes a function to be decorated as its argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the code that interacts with the decorated function can remain the same as when the funciton was undecorated.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Example of **profiling_decorator** function</u>\n",

    "```python\n",
    "def profiling_decorator(f):\n",
    "    def wrapped_f(*args):\n",
    "        start_time = time.time()\n",
    "        result = self.f(*args)\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The decorator function must return a function to be used when the decorated function is called. The returned function is used to wrap the decorated function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Closure**: to have a closure, you have to have one function (i.e. `profiling_decorator`) returning another function (i.e. `wrapped_f`) nested within itself, with the nested function referring to a variable (i.e. `f`) within the scope of the enclosing function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Decorating Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Somethimes it would be useful to decorate the class and have the Python know to apply the decoration to each method in the class. This can be achieved through a class and the `__getattribute__()` magic method: it is used to retrieve methods and attributes for an object, and by overriding this method it is possible to add the decorator."
