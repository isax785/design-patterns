    "# 2. The Prototype Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Prototype Pattern** favors <u>composition over inheritance</u>. \n",
    "\n",
    "Classes that are composed of parts allow you to substitute those parts at runtime, profoundly affecting the testability and maintainability of the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "The classes to instantiate are specified at runtime by means of **dynamic loading**. The result of this characteristic of the prototype pattern is that sub-classing is reduced significantly. The complexities of creating a new instance are hidden from the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main benefit of this pattern is that it forces you to program to an interface, which leads to better design.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Prototype Pattern** is just a `clone()` function that accepts an object as an input parameter and returns a clone of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Note:</u> deep-cloning classes with circular references can and will cause issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three components needed for prototype pattern are:\n",
    "1. Client creates a <u>new object by asking a prototype to clone itself</u>.\n",
    "2. Prototype declares an interface for cloning itself.\n",
    "3. Concrete prototype implements the operation for cloning itself.\n"

    "*What is this pattern about?\n",
    "This patterns aims to reduce the number of classes required by an\n",
    "application. Instead of relying on subclasses it creates objects by\n",
    "copying a prototypical instance at run-time.\n",
    "\n",

    "When the number of prototypes in an application can vary, it can be\n",
